Benchmarking Code
-----------------

In ProbNum computational cost with regard to time and memory is measured via a benchmark suite in :code:`probnum/benchmarks`.
Benchmarks are run by `airspeed velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ which tracks
performance changes over time. You can check out
`ProbNum's benchmarks <https://probabilistic-numerics.github.io/probnum/benchmarks/index.html>`_ or run them locally
on your machine via

.. code-block:: bash

    cd probnum/benchmarks
    asv run
    asv publish
    asv preview

You can then view the benchmark suite in your browser. If you want to add a new benchmark follow
`this tutorial <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing_benchmarks.html>`_.
