Benchmarking Code
-----------------

In ProbNum computational cost with regard to time and memory is measured via a benchmark suite in `probnum/benchmarks`.
Benchmarks are run by `airspeed velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ which tracks
performance changes over time. You can check out `ProbNum's benchmarks <coming soon>`_ or run them locally on your
machine via:
```bash
cd probnum/benchmarks
asv run
asv publish
asv preview
```
If you want to add a new benchmark follow `this tutorial <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing_benchmarks.html>`_.
